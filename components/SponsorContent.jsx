                <p2 >Your sponsorship helps towards food, vaccinations, medical care, spaying/neutering and toys for your
                 sponsored friend and allows us to help even more animals.<br></br><br></br></p2>
                 <p2 >A lot of the animals in our sponsorship 
                 program are long term residents who will probably never be adopted - often due to medical issues, 
                 problems socializing with people, or they just 
                simply haven't found that special owner yet. Older animals have such a hard time finding homes.</p2><br></br>
                <p2 >In exchange for sponsoring one of our furry friends, we will: <br></br></p2> 
                <p2>   - Organize a visit to your sponsored pet; dependent on both of your locations. <br></br></p2>
                <p2>   - Email you regular updates on your sponsor pet's progress. <br></br></p2> 
                <p2>   - Publish your name on the sponsorship list that we regularly release on our blog and social media channels. 
      (Do let us know if you wish to remain anonymous.)</p2>
